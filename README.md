This is a functional chat implementation project that was developed using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Inspired by the popular brasilian chat website and utilizes an API to connect to the chat room. Messages are displayed in three types - status, private, and normal. It also includes automatic scrolling and message reloading every three seconds to keep the conversation up-to-date.

In addition, the project also included a simple login page that prompts the user to enter their name. Once entered, it is registered on the server, and they can enter the chat room. The user's presence is updated every 5 seconds, and they can send messages that include the sender, destination, and message type. Clicking on the side, a modal pops up and shows all online participants. Overall, the project provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for online conversations.
